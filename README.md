This sample app is a test of Sinatra. User can input values in a URL to test to see if they are anagrams.

##Use

This Sinatra app runs on localhost://4567. User can check two words to see if they are anagrams like so:

'http://localhost:4567/anagram/?word1=word&word2=drow'*

*word1 being the first word, word2 being the second word

Browser output for example:

'{"Anagram":"This is an Anagram"}'
